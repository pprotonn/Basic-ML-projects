# Basic ML Projects

Welcome to **Basic-ML-projects**! This repository brings together practical, beginner-to-intermediate machine learning projects created to demonstrate essential ML workflows on real-world datasets using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## üöÄ Projects Included

- **Bulldozer Price Predictor**  
  End-to-end regression pipeline for predicting the sale price of bulldozers based on their usage history and specifications. Great example of preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation for tabular data.

- **Heart Disease Classification**  
  Complete workflow for binary classification of heart-disease presence, including data exploration, visualization, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance analysis.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bulldozer_price_predictor.ipynb             # Bulldozer price regression ML workflow
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb # Heart disease detection/classification ML workflow
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ‚úÖ How to Use

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pprotonn/Basic-ML-projects.git
   cd Basic-ML-projects
   ```
2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. **Open any notebook and follow along:**
   - `Bulldozer_price_predictor.ipynb`
   - `end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb`

Each notebook contains step-by-step explanations and runnable code for all stages of the ML workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Modeling:** Linear models, tree-based models, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Error metrics, ROC curves, and model interpretability.
- **Visualization:** Plots and charts for deeper data/model understanding.
